what is html ? HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard
markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. HTML
describes the structure of web pages using a series of elements, which are
represented by tags. These tags define various parts of the content, such as
headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other multimedia elements. HTML is not
a programming language; rather, it is a markup language that provides the basic
building blocks for web content. It allows developers to structure text and
embed images, videos, and other media, making it possible to create interactive
and visually appealing web pages. HTML documents are typically saved with a
.html or .htm file extension and can be viewed in web browsers. The language is
designed to be easy to learn and use, making it accessible for beginners while
also providing advanced features for experienced developers. HTML is often used
in conjunction with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and JavaScript for
interactivity, allowing developers to create dynamic and responsive web
applications. The combination of these technologies forms the foundation of
modern web development. HTML is constantly evolving, with new versions
introducing additional features and improvements. The latest version, HTML5,
includes support for multimedia elements like audio and video, as well as new
semantic elements that enhance the structure and accessibility of web content.
HTML is essential for anyone looking to create websites or web applications, as
it provides the framework upon which all web content is built. Understanding
HTML is the first step in becoming a web developer or designer, and it serves as
a foundation for learning other web technologies. what is meaning oh hypertext ?
Hypertext refers to a system of organizing and linking information in a
non-linear way, allowing users to navigate through content by clicking on
hyperlinks. In the context of HTML, hypertext enables the creation of web pages
that can be interconnected through links, allowing users to easily access
related information across different documents or websites. Hypertext is a key
feature of the World Wide Web, as it allows for a more interactive and
user-friendly experience. Instead of reading content in a linear fashion, users
can jump from one piece of information to another by clicking on hyperlinks,
which can lead to other web pages, documents, or resources. examples of
hypertext include: 1. **Web Links**: Clicking on a link in a web page that takes
you to another page or website. 2. **Table of Contents**: A list of links at the
beginning of a document that allows users to jump to different sections within
the same document. 3. **Footnotes**: Links at the bottom of a page that provide
additional information or references related to the content. 4. **Related
Articles**: Links to other articles or resources that are relevant to the
content being viewed examples :
<a href="https://www.example.com">Example Link</a> 5. **Navigation Menus**:
Menus that allow users to navigate through different sections of a website by
clicking on links.
