  //Symbol is a new primitive data type introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).

  // It represents a unique and immutable value that can be used as an identifier for object properties.

  // Symbols are often used to create private properties or methods in objects, as they cannot be accessed or modified by other code.
  let mySymbol = Symbol('description');
  let anotherSymbol = Symbol('description');

  console.log(mySymbol); // Output: Symbol(description)
  console.log(anotherSymbol); // Output: Symbol(description)
