  // null is a special value in JavaScript that represents the intentional absence of any object value.
  // It is often used to indicate that a variable should not point to any object or value.

  let myVariable = null;
  console.log(myVariable); // Output: null

  console.log(typeof myVariable); // Output: object

  // Note: The typeof operator returns "object" for null, which is a historical bug in JavaScript.
